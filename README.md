# Border-effect-corrections-for-diagonal-line-based-recurrence-quantification-analysis-measures
This repository contains all correction schemes proposed and used in the article "Border effect corrections for diagonal line based
recurrence quantification analysis measures" (submitted to Physics Letters A). There are basically two kinds of corrections: 
1) correction schemes for counting the diagonal lines in a recurrence plot (the dl_-functions) and 
2) correction schemes for the recurrence plot itself in order to suppress the effect of tangential motion (the rp_-functions)
See the respective docstring for further information.
In order to properly run the provided code you might need to install the CRP toolbox by
Norbert Marwan (open source; http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/CRPtoolbox/) and the Signal
Processing toolbox from MathWorks (just for the rp_LM2P-function; https://de.mathworks.com/products/signal.html)
